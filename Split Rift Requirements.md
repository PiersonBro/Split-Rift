The goal is to build a command line based text adventure game. The basic form of the game would be a series of decisions the player makes interspersed with text based descriptions of the consequences of those decisions. The game must be able to have decisions that are based off of   predetermined paths. A predetermined path would like the adventurer equipping a sword, a decision which cannot fail. Finally the program should be able to tell multiple stories depending on the narrative file loaded into the game, in the final implemenation this is only partially implemented. 

The game should be able to work on both Windows and Mac. The game will depend on a human readable and writeable file as initial input that will determine the game’s story and structure. Regardless of whether or not this is settable by the user, this should be treated by the game as an input allowing for other stories to be told using the same game. During the game, the only input will be the user’s decisions as they play the game from the command line. The output which will be to the command line, should be a combination of the written text provided by the file input and the ensuing transformations necessary to make the game a dynamic experience instead of a static set of choices. (This is acheived but in a very limited sense)
